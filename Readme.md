## Tree Animation Project

# Description
This project implements a tree animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The tree grows branches, bears fruit, drops fruit, and repeats the cycle in an animated sequence.

# Files
index.html: The HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the webpage.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the tree animation logic.

# Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
$ Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Benah0987/tree-animation.git
Open the index.html file in your web browser.

# Usage
The tree animation will start automatically when you open the webpage.
Watch as the tree grows branches, bears fruit, drops fruit, and repeats the cycle.
The "Tree Planting Day" message will be displayed once the tree-building process is complete.

# Customization
You can customize the appearance of the tree and the webpage by modifying the CSS in the style.css file.
Adjust the animation parameters and behavior in the script.js file if needed.
